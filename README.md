### NeoWs Asteroid Data Parser

### Description
This project implements a parser designed to extract and organize data on Near Earth Objects (NEOs) from NASAâ€™s NeoWs API, providing a structured view of asteroid characteristics and their proximity to Earth.

### Technical Description
The parser fetches JSON data through a web request to the NASA NeoWs API, processes it using specific grammar rules tailored for NEO data, and outputs it in a structured format, ready for analysis. The parser specifically extracts key attributes, such as asteroid size, speed, date of closest approach, and hazardous status.

### Applications
The NeoWs Asteroid Data Parser has several valuable applications, including:

-Risk Assessment and Tracking: By identifying potentially hazardous asteroids, this data supports risk assessment initiatives and ongoing monitoring of objects that pose a potential threat to Earth.
-Research and Simulation Models: The organized data can be used to build models for simulating asteroid trajectories, helping scientists study near-Earth object behavior over time.
-Data Visualization: The structured data can be visualized on interactive charts and maps, illustrating asteroid approaches to Earth and trends in NEO occurrences.
-Public Awareness and Education: The parser can be integrated into educational tools, providing accessible information on asteroids and raising public awareness about space safety and NEO monitoring.
